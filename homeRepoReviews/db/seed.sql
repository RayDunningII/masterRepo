reading and watching reviews on cameras/doorbells and decided on the Nest Hello. Most reviews seem to give it 
an edge over other devices. My wife asked if we really 'needed' one of these video doorbells. I agreed and 
said, 'probably not' since we already have a commercial grade monitored security system and rarely have any 
problems with theft/vandalism in our neighborhood. However, after installing and using the Hello, I began to 
realize how good it is to have the ability to monitor activities when we are not home, are away on vacation, 
expecting a package delivery, or want to monitor when family members arrive home. It's even interesting to 
watch what our dog does outside for hours. Installation was not that complicated but I did (as expected) have 
to install a new low voltage transformer. Most door chimes will not have enough juice to power the device. 
You'll need at least 12-14 volts I believe. I found a new door chime kit that came with a simple 16v 
transformer for about the same price as another transformer itself. It was not that difficult but I am 
comfortable doing my own basic electrical work once I was 100% sure I turned the correct breaker off. I was 
lucky and was able to place the doorbell in the same location as the old one. After some experimenting, I 
decided to use the angle bracket as to see less of the brick of the front of our house. The most difficult 
part is trying to use the small security tool at the bottom of the unit....and making sure you put it in a 
safe place where it won't be lost. It is really small. It took some crouching and craning my neck but maybe 
that's a good idea to prevent theft. The camera is working very well and the resolution is very good. Night 
time is pretty good too. I really like the Nest app and the desktop web page. I can leave it up on my computer 
at work and watch live video feed anytime I want. I have experimented with the notifications because it can 
get annoying getting a message on your phone every time a car drives by, a loud sound goes off, or a neighbor 
is walking their dog. I finally set a zone for parts of the front of the house and only get notifications if a 
person enters. I'm not sure if this constant live feed and being able to review a day's worth of footage will 
remain after the free trial period. Initially, I was not interested in yet another monthly fee. But if I have 
to pay the up front fee of $50 for the year to have the same functions as the trial, it will be worth it.",

Yes,it is PVC but looks awesome when up. Easy to clean.Requires 2 men to put this together.Took me 8 hours to 
fully install with my wife. Good Luck putting together but very happy with it.", 9, 0, 3.8, 1013);

have to worry about the steam from the shower affecting it. Only issue I had was the bolts provided to attach 
the handle were not long enough, so I had to buy new bolts and nuts. I also had to make some custom metal 
brackets to accommodate my particular install location, but that is to be expected since I was not installing 
the door onto a flat wall. I also had to buy some heavy duty drywall anchors since I had to install into 
drywall in my application. So far, the door is functioning great. My wife and I love it. I would buy another 
one. The door rolls smoothly, the hardware seems strong. The door stops work great, as well as the door guide 
to prevent the door from swinging. I have had this door installed for about 3 weeks now without any issues. 
Assembly of the door took me approximately an hour or so. Hanging the door track took another hour or so (I 
had to run to Home Depot to get hardware). I am very happy with the quality of the door and how it is 
onstructed. Only reason for four stars from me, is that I had to buy bolts and nuts to install the handle.",

rail above the door took 1 1/2 hours because the holes in it were 17.5 inches apart. Why? Did they think those 
holes would have a chance of lining up with any studs in the wall? I drilled two additional holes in order for 
me to hit the studs in the wall for the lag bolts. How about adding a drill bit and have the customer drill 
holes in a blank rail for all the studs. Door needed to be assembled. 2 1/2 hours. Directions were tough to 
follow. Had to go to Youtube which helped. Video should have showed close ups of end of stiles etc. to make 
identification easier. Because of poor directions I made a couple of mistakes which required me to redo a few 
things. Handle had bolts too short to connect to the nut on the other side! Had to buy longer ones and paint 
them, then attached the handle.", 8, 0, 3.8, 1013);
